# Praise O

<br />

Hey, I'm Praise - I'm a software engineer who runs [ShotbyPraise](https://www.shotbypraise.com) and [Professionally Curious](https://professionallycurious.com). I work across software, visuals, and creative systems

## What I Do

I’m a builder and visual storyteller. I run Professionally Curious, where I create digital products and practical tools, building thoughtful products and helping good ideas work. My work spans product thinking, creative technology, and solutions that remove friction.

I also run shotbypraise, where all my photography and video work lives. Both sides of my work feed into each other: clear thinking, strong visuals, and simple systems.
